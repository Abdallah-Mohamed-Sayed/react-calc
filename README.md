## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start using the calculator:

- Click on the number buttons to input digits.
- Click on the operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `ร`, `รท`) to perform calculations.
- Click on `AC` to clear the display and reset the calculator.
- Click on `DEL` to delete the last typed digit.
- Click on `=` to evaluate the expression.

### Decimal Input

- The calculator supports decimal points. Typing a decimal point (`.`) will insert it after a number. If the input already contains a decimal point, it will not allow more than one decimal.

### Formatting

- The numbers are formatted with thousands separators (e.g., `1,000`).
- If a decimal point is typed, it will appear in the display as you type, and the calculator will handle decimal input correctly.
